#FunDAO: Non-Plutonian DAO on Ethereum Blockchain
FunDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) hosted on the Ethereum blockchain with the purpose of creating a fair and transparent decision-making process. Our DAO is non-plutonian, which means that we don't have a single entity or group in charge of making decisions for the entire organization. Instead, we use a system of delegates and members to ensure that decisions are made collectively and fairly.

##Delegate System
Our DAO assigns delegates through a voting process that takes into account both delegate votes and member votes. The delegate vote is calculated as follows:

```code
 delegate vote = (n(d) / n(m))
```
Where n(d) is the number of delegate votes and n(m) is the number of member votes. This ensures that delegates are chosen based on the support they receive from both delegates and members.

##Proposals
Any member of FunDAO can propose an idea for a new project, investment, change, or removal of a member. Main proposals and delegate proposals are made by members. FunDAO allows for one proposal at a time, and the minimum proposal time is one week, while the maximum is one month. This ensures that proposals are carefully considered and discussed before a final decision is made.

##Voting on Proposals
Once a proposal has been made, all members of FunDAO have the opportunity to vote on it. A proposal is considered approved if it receives a majority vote from both delegates and members.

##Fun Token
FunDAO uses an ERC-20 token called "Fun Token". Members can use Fun Token to participate in voting and decision-making processes within the DAO. The number of Fun Tokens a member holds determines their voting power.

##Escrow Contract
To ensure the safety and security of our members' investments, FunDAO uses an escrow contract. The escrow contract holds funds until a proposal is approved, at which point the funds are released for the intended purpose.

##Future Plans
In the future, FunDAO plans to vote on the next project to invest in, make investments with our treasury, and vote on any changes to our organization. Additionally, we will have the ability to remove members from our DAO, and any investments made by a removed member will be given back to the DAO.

##Conclusion
FunDAO is committed to creating a fair and transparent decision-making process for all members. By using a delegate system, carefully considering proposals, and using an escrow contract, we believe that our organization can make a positive impact on the Ethereum community.
